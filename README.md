# youface-web
Served as a Flask server for my photogaphy website that was hosted on Digitalocean. I shutdown the server in order to move on to Django to enable scaling up the website.

# Functionalities
The website had a mobile and desktop user-friendly interface. The website served as a sharepoint for my clients to view their event pictures.

# Note 
Sorry for the lack of documentation but the code is explanotory and function have specifications etc.

# How to run
Execute the `flaskr/main.py`.
