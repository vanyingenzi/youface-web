# youface-web
Served as a Flask server for a website that was hosted on Digitalocean. I shutdown the server in order to move on to Django in order to be able to scale up the server.

# Note 
Sorry for the lack of documentation but the code is explanotory and function have specification etc.

# How to run
Execute the `flaskr/main.py`.
